# SEARCH
search: I want to search for the following using the google search engine. Format the text into a succinct search to help me find what I am looking for. Return only the text of the search query. Optimize the search for returning good search results leaving off anything that would not be useful in searching. Rather than searching for exact strings, I want to find a search that is as close as possible. I will take care of putting it into a search.
